## [Unreleased]

## [7.0.6] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Honor the IDE's certificate and proxy settings for outbound HTTPS requests.
- Scale the session UI correctly with IDE zoom, fixing double-scaled heights and extra empty space in the transcript and prompt composer.

## [7.0.5] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Add an elapsed-time indicator to the session progress footer so long-running tasks show how long they have been active.
- Support importing legacy JetBrains v5 data directly from raw storage when the previous consolidated migration file is unavailable.

### Fixed

- Restore the v5 migration wizard for users whose legacy provider, OAuth, MCP, mode, setting, or session data was not detected during upgrade.
- Improve migration reliability by preserving checklist todos, importing legacy tool calls as assistant parts, validating raw session IDs, and reducing migration memory usage.
- Polish session controls with more native prompt icons, progress footer spacing, auto-hiding prompt scrollbars, and improved rollback/redo scrolling.

### Changed

- Keep the JetBrains plugin pinned to Kilo Core 7.4.5 for this release.

## [7.0.4] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Stop orphaned Kilo Core processes on Windows so closing the IDE no longer leaves a lingering `kilo serve` process or blocks the next IDE launch.
- Improve JetBrains CLI shutdown ordering so app close kills the process tree before closing streams, preventing Windows shutdown deadlocks.

## [7.0.3] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Add rollback redo controls in JetBrains sessions so reverted changes can be restored from the chat UI.
- Add inline revert progress in JetBrains sessions, including localized status text and safer cancellation handling.
- Add Kilo Core support for localized commit-message generation, AI image generation, large bash-output pruning, and improved model-usage display.

### Fixed

- Harden Kilo Core startup and shutdown so startup failures show clearer diagnostics, app close stops the CLI process, and lingering child processes are cleaned up more reliably.
- Fix workspace reload recovery so stale reload state no longer disrupts the session connection.
- Fix JetBrains rollback and revert flows so prompt focus, scroll state, diff order, and turn state are preserved more reliably.
- Fix Kilo Core Bedrock SSO credential resolution and commit-message error handling when no changes are available.

## [7.0.2] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Improve JetBrains runtime CLI download reliability by pruning stale binaries, using the shell environment for PATH resolution, and surfacing exact release-resolution failures.

### Changed

- Polish JetBrains chat UI with auto-collapsing reasoning previews, clearer retry/offline footer state, and more balanced prompt, code, question, todo, history, and popup spacing.
- Show the active routed model name and remote status more consistently in CLI runtime surfaces.

## [7.0.2-rc.2] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Show compact previews for collapsed reasoning blocks so long assistant reasoning stays readable without taking over the transcript.

### Fixed

- Resolve the CLI executable using the user's shell environment so custom PATH setups work when sessions start from JetBrains.
- Keep retry and offline status visible in the session footer while preserving transcript context.
